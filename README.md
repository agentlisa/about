## About AgentLISA
AgentLISA is the first Agentic Security Operating System for Web3, built to secure smart contracts at the speed of modern development.

## Our Mission
Every month, more than 200,000+ smart contracts are deployed—yet 80% remain unaudited. Traditional security audits are slow, expensive, and often miss deep logic flaws. AgentLISA was founded to solve this fundamental gap: bringing real-time, agentic security to every Web3 builder.

## What We Do
AgentLISA introduces the world’s first agentic AI auditor, capable of detecting business-logic vulnerabilities that standard static or symbolic tools overlook. Our multi-agent system deeply analyzes contract interactions, protocol-level logic, and execution paths—going far beyond syntax or pattern matching.

With AgentLISA, teams can ship safely 99% faster, running an end-to-end security analysis in minutes instead of weeks.

## Key Capabilities
- ⚡ 99% faster audits — full logic analysis in minutes
- 🌐 14+ supported chains — Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Base, Arbitrum, Solana, and more
- 👩‍💻 Developer-first integrations — VSCode, Cursor, GitHub, CI/CD
- 🔤 Multi-language support — Solidity & Rust with unified reporting
